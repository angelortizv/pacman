## Motivation

In 1980, Namco created a character that was small, round and yellow. It's mouth consisted of a piece cut out of the main circle, like a slice of cake. Pac-Man was born. It was a huge hit in the arcades across the globe, and Pac-Man is still going strong today. With every new generation of game systems, Pac-Man continues to be part of the gaming community.
